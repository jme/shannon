# shannon.ml

This is a straightforward implementation of a basic Shannon Entropy calculator.

It's written in stock OCaml and uses a mutable Hashtbl for binning.

[Wikipedia entry on Shannon Entropy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29)

 

## howto
Run from command line, passing in a string or, with the -f flag, a filename.
Returns the basic Shannon Entropy in bits.

Uses Streams and is fairly fast; file IO will probably account for most of the run time.


###a few examples

Shannon Entropy of the string "1223334444" (also contained in the demo.txt file)
character count: 10
alphabet size: 4
value: 1.84643934467


the text of "The Time Machine", by H.G. Welles
character count: 178937
alphabet size: 70
value: 4.42227483271


"Alice in Wonderland", by Lewis Carroll
character count: 163783
alphabet size: 87
value: 4.5903438441


genome text of the Enterobacteria phage phiX174
character count: 5386
alphabet size: 4
value: 1.9845793595


executable binary file of the shannon program itself (linux x64)
character count: 439109
alphabet size: 255
value: 5.47700872144


## brief dev notes

After a couple of variations using persistent data structures data structures I just went ahead and settled on the mutable Hashtbl for in-place binning operations. 

In a similar nod to speed the core ops of the primary folds are pre-baked as much as possible.
Tested with files up to a few hundred MBs but should handle more nominally.


Also: the core operation code is similar to the simple string-only Shannon Entropy OCaml example I previously wrote for the [Rosetta Code site](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Entropy)


## Prerequisites `

Written with standard OCaml 4.01, no extra libs required
